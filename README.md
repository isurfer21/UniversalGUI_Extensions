 - **Synchronise** the *cloned repository* with your *working repository* before starting new task or at your will.
 - **Reverse synchronise** your *working repository* with the *cloned repository* when task gets completed or at your will.

#### Compatible with
 - Mac OSX, Windows, Linux

#### Note:
 - **Cloned repository** &rarr; It refers to git repository that is cloned from remote branch
 - **Working repository** &rarr; It refers to git repository that is local *working repository* based on *cloned repository*
